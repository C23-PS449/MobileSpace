# Description

In this repository, you will find our project called RiceBuddy funded by Bangkit Academy 2023. RiceBuddy is an android apps that built to ease rice paddy farmer especially, a new budding rice buddy farmer that want to imporve their farming Quality of Life or simply a user that want to explore about rice paddy disease. RiceBuddy is bulit using Kotlin programming language and consist several features that can be used by it's user. Following are the features that built in the application :
  - Authorization features to make things secure
  - A built-in weather checker that automatically changed based on your location
  - A built-in news featuring agriculture issue. User can check the detail about  news in their built-in browser
  - A star in our apps the feature to detect rice paddy disease based on their leaf condition, user can use camera to capture image or choosing available image on their gallery. The result of the detection including the name of the disease, description of the disease and the prevention and curing method for the disease. Currently our apps consist only four classification result : Healthy, BrownSpot Disease, LeafBlast Disease and Hispa Disease.
  - Another star in our apps is the features to check agriculture shop based on user location. This features not only shows name of the shop and their address but it will also giving the direction to the shop using Google Maps or other Maps application on user phone.
  - Lastly is the forum apps which is currently not completely done. Currently this features can only send a basic chat which can be seen by other user in the apps.

# Future of this project
As mentioned before, this project is not completely done and in the future our teams will create following features to further easing our apps user :
 - Adding more library for our disease detection so the apps not only will detect rice paddy disease but also detecting most common plant planted by farmed such as chilli pepper, cabbage, corn, and many more.
 - Currently our apps is relied Google Nearby Search API to give user the location of nearest agriculture shop. In the future, we like to add feature for small shop owner to promote their shop in the application. This will promote small agriculture shop business to grow by giving them chance to shine more than bigger companies.
 - A fully functioning forum so user can post their problems revolving their planting task, of course to prevent a topic outside of agriculture we will also built a text detection model that automatically detect the content of the forum that will be posted.
 - Adding a feature to check current selling price of certain plant based on the user location, this is to prevent a cheating middleman to make a egregious profit by milking new farmer.
 - Lastly a feature that consist full guidance for the user about how to plant certain plant, a reminder to giving plant fertilizer or other medicine, and other cultivation tips. This is actually the main star of the project but due to unfortunate circumtances, we cannot develop this features.

Note that all of the things above are still a "plan", so we can't make a promise that we will able to built those ideas
